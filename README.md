<h1 align="center">Bonjour, I'm Astrid!</h1>
<h2 align="center">A new Fullstack developer everywhere in the world 🌎</h2>

<p align="center">I'm from France and currently based in Berlin. 
I have worked in  <b>various start-ups</b> in Paris and Berlin (<i>Too Good To Go, Foodora</i>), occupying different positions in Sales and Success. Working closely with the Tech team made me want to learn more, so I decided to attend **the Wagon bootcamp**. Now I have a great interest in code and want to deepen my knowledge by practicing!</p>
<p align="center">I’m currently working to improve my skills on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - but I'm also learning German and Portuguese!
I would love to work for <b>projects with social and/or environmental impact</b>.</p>
<br>

### ☀️ MY CODING PROJECTS
During my bootcamp at Le Wagon, I developed various projects:
- [RentMyStuff](https://github.com/AstrouCh/rent_my_stuff), a marketplace to rent anything
- [WeekEnd](https://github.com/rmPablo1/weekend), a calendar where you can import your personal calendar and share it with your friends - ideal to find the perfect date to meet!

### ☀️ EXPERIENCES
Apart from coding, I have strong experience in **processes automation and optimization**, using (a lot) *Excel and Zapier* for example. I worked for years as Account Manager, and also have sales skills. 
My greatest strength is that **I communicate a lot**. This makes it easy to resolve conflicts when they arise, but also to have fun while working! I'm a good **problem solver**.

<br>

### ☀️ ABOUT MYSELF WHEN I'M NOT WORKING...

...  I love to learn new stuff in general. I think I can be defined as a hedonist, I like to spend time in the nature as much as I like to spend time in bars with friends. I listen to a lot of music (here is my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/soeur-astrid)) and I do sports like yoga, contemporary dance, hiking. I travel quite a bit.
